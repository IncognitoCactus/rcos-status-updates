## Last Week's Accomplishments

Last week, we held our first full group meeting, determined LVP, and assigned frontend/backend teams. In addition, I began work on getting up-to-speed in regards to required development languages.

## This Week's Plan

Once the frontend framework is released, I plan to begin work on the first frontend prototype. In the meantime, I will continue learning the required languages to ensure the process wil go smoothly.

Several exams in the coming week will impede progress, in addition to the delayed frontend framework.
